### Euphony 
1) Sample App Proposal 


    > Wave-Show-Card helps visually impaired people listen to the show card. ðŸ›’


    - https://github.com/euphony-io/wave-show-card
    - https://github.com/euphony-io/euphony/issues/178
- [PR] show card android receiver 

  > We built and applied euphony-listener in java to implement a sound wave signal receiver app suitable for the Euterpe team. Since it is an app for the visually impaired, it is possible to receive sound wave signals with a single touch.
  - https://github.com/euphony-io/wave-show-card/issues/4
- [Feat] Develop Text to Speech 
  > When the web show card sends a sound wave signal, the app receives it, and the received string is played back by voice.


  - https://github.com/euphony-io/wave-show-card/issues/15 
- [PR] Converting Android receiver code to kotlin (jetpack compose)

  > The sound wave signal receiver app implemented in Java has only UI implemented using compose.
  - https://github.com/euphony-io/wave-show-card/pull/18
- [Code Reiview] :

2) Add Euphony Issue Templete
    > Updated latest issue template with customizable web form fields

    - https://github.com/euphony-io/euphony/pull/176
    - https://github.com/euphony-io/euphony/issues/137
    - https://github.com/DahyeonWoo/issue-template-tutorial/commit/16f3e64d545f045138fe6443c871551565d76d4c
3) Add an advanced log for calling listen() without permission

    > Euphony calls listen() to check for audio permissions. We found that the Euphony sample app is forced to close when the user does not accept the audio        permission request and runs it. As a workaround for listen() , it prints an error log notifying the user that the required permission has not been accepted. And I uploaded the test code of listen() after receiving a review from the maintainer.
